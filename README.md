# Financial-Reporting-with-Power-BI-Dashboard
The project titled "Financial Reporting with Power BI Dashboard" showcases the utilization of Microsoft Power BI to revolutionize traditional financial reporting methods. By transitioning to dynamic BI dashboards, the project significantly streamlines the reporting process while enhancing efficiency in accessing vital financial data. The developed financial dashboards encompass various views, including a Financial Overview, Income Statement, and Balance Sheet. These dashboards offer dynamic features such as KPI tracking, scenario toggling, and the ability to seamlessly switch between graphical and tabular data representations. This transformation not only automates reporting but also empowers users with enhanced decision-making capabilities through data visualization and analysis.
